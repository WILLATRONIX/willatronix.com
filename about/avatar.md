# Avatar

Unlike my username, my avatar has gone through many changes. Some changes are more noticeable than others.

This is the avatar used for the [CuboxYT username](username#will-the-madman--cuboxyt). The watermark for the online photo creation site can be seen at the bottom right, however I cannot find the site.

![Avatar 1](/img/about-willatronix/avatar/1.webp)

This is the very first iteration of the WILLATRONIX avatar, featuring a Minecraft screenshot of two dolphins. Designed in the online [Adobe Photo Maker](https://www.adobe.com/express/create/logo).

This is the original screenshot taken on the 25th of February 2020 at 17:07:38 UTC.

This was again made with the Adobe Photo Maker, though this uses one of their pre-made backgrounds.

![Avatar 3](/img/about-willatronix/avatar/3.webp)

This was the second iteration of the previous avatar, made later in 2021.

![Avatar 4](/img/about-willatronix/avatar/4.webp)

This avatar uses the same text and green border of the previous avatar, but uses a cropped version of [BubiksCube's Firewatch Dual Monitor Wallpaper](https://imgur.com/gallery/firewatch-dual-monitor-wallpaper-Jndd5du).

![Avatar 4a](/img/about-willatronix/avatar/4a.webp)

This version has a hue shift to apply different colours. This was done to test different options, however was later used for my few alternate accounts.

![Avatar 4b](/img/about-willatronix/avatar/4b.webp)

This avatar was specifically made for Halloween, made as a small joke, mocking my avatar style.

![Avatar 5](/img/about-willatronix/avatar/5.webp)

This avatar used some AI generation to reduce the usage of the original author's image. Though this is used very little across platforms as its extremely similar to the previous ones. It also sharpened the edges on the green borders and removed the darker greens.

![Avatar 5a](/img/about-willatronix/avatar/5a.webp)

This was made as a small test to see if adding harsh shadows would make the text more visible against the background, however this didn't work as much as I would have hoped.
