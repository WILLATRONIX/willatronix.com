# Usernames

Though I share the same username across all platforms now, it's had some changes.

## Willatronix

My very first username was "Willatronix", chosen by me and my parents in 2014. Initially we tried Willatron, but that was already taken. "Willatronix" was chosen for my new [Playstation 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_3) account.

## WILLATRONIX

Later, after receiving my new computer in 2018, I used full capitalization for all letters, now making the username "WILLATRONIX".

## Will The Madman / CuboxYT

However, in 2019, I changed my username to "Will The Madman" across many platforms. This was done in the search for a new username. The name was only kept for a month until I changed it to "CuboxYT". 

## WILLATRONIX

"CuboxYT" was kept for over 2 months until I changed it back to "WILLATRONIX" across all platforms.

To this day, I doubt I will ever change this username.
