# The Axiom (Incomplete)

This build started off as a joke idea, but then turned into a pretty decent plan.

Each segment of the Axiom logo will represent three different building styles:

- Blue
  - Fantasy organic(s)
- Green
  - Realistic terrain
- Red
  - Dystopian structures

Each segment will work its best to power its own core. For example, the red segment will use coal and steam to keep the core alive. Each core will work together to unite these three building styles using the centerpiece.

## Current Progress

This is the current state of the structure. The trains will transport coal to feed the coal plants which will keep the core alive.
