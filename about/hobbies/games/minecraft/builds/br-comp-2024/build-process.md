# Build Process

Here are a collection of screenshots (some with descriptions) that show the build stages in order of old to most new.

A very basic test made before the comp, just something to work off in my head.

The first stages of the build, however I decided to work top to bottom. This ended up being a mistake later on.

Removed the top cabin and fixed some proportions. I also got the wood texture sorted out.

The second attempt, started over and made a slightly darker texture for the wood. Working bottom to top should have been more obvious.

A method I used to generate grass. As shown with glass and wool, the grass length is determined by light, while the grass density is determined by moisture. I then coded a brush using Axiom's Script Brush feature to combine these factors into "real" grass.
