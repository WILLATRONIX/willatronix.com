# WILLATRONIX's Firewatch Tower

![Finished Build](/img/about-willatronix/hobbies/games/minecraft/builds/br-2024/index/finised-build.webp)

Taking a total of 206 hours, this lookout tower took a lot of effort to construct and finish. Every detail possible has been added so there is nothing to hide other than minor mistakes.

## Solitary Theme

Represented by the Firewatch game, working in a fire lookout tower is one of the most solitary jobs in the world. All alone to yourself in the vast wilderness. The only touch of humanity is through a copper wire.

## Details You May Miss

- Every plank of wood has nails, other than wood that can be glued
- Insulation has been put in the walls, floor and ceiling.
- Gas and power cables lead to their appropriate destination.
- The slanted planks on the walls are held with small bits of wood nailed to the wall.
- The grass was generated using a custom algorithm that factored light and moisture.
- All wood textures are unique.

## Further Information

The build was made mostly in the Axiom Editor Mode and some of the props were hand-modelled. Though all texturing was done with Axiom.

The time of year for this build is summer, as it's dry and wood is plentiful.

## What I Would Do If I Built This Again

I would reference the official standard linked in [References](references.md#other-references-used) to accurately follow the same rules as a lookout tower would in terms of scale and measurements.

I would also scale down the wood texture as it was too stretched.

## Judging Criteria Goals

While building, I tried to not to overthink the main judging criteria as they were pretty easy to achieve once you've put enough work into the build.

#### Aesthetics 

I tried to make everything look as good as possible, redoing multiple things such as the cabin and scale multiple times so I can get it looking as good as I can. The texturing fine-tuning to get the best wood look possible.

Each prop was carefully made, considering scale and texturing.

#### Complexity

The complex parts of my build include the super realistic design and some of the scripts used to automate the tedious building process.

The diagonal cross-planks have a very complex texturing process, as I need to generate a noised based texture on a diagonal axis.

#### Originality 

While the idea of building a lookout tower is not quite original, the design itself is completely unique.

### Subcategory Judging

This build aims to achieve the following subcategories:

- Best Survival Friendly (Non-Debugged)

All blockstates in this build are 100% survival friendly, from the blocks used, all the way to string supporting all falling blocks

- Best Realistic

Every part of the structure has been designed to represent a real structure as close as possible, with accurate electricity cables and insulation to portray the realism further.

- Best Megabuild

As you can see, I've made the most of my plot space. Though this came at the cost of time.

The build is exactly 300x381x300.

- Best Interior

Full of all the essentials a lookout person would need, the interior is packed with lots of interesting objects.

## Props 

There are lots of detailed props scattered throughout the build, all varying in size and details.
