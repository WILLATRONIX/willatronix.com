# Build Process

As this build is still in its early stages, there won't be as much to show in this build process.

Learning from the Norwegian map, instead of starting from a flat surface, I will instead carve out existing terrain to reduce the effect of brush strokes appearing on the map view. This doesn't mean I won't be using the same tools.

Shrub assets used for the build. Each species of bush has five variations to remove repetition.

Tree assets, similar to how I have the bushes set up, but with less variants.

Created a polygon-like terrain shape, and started to carve out the cliff shape.

A quick test using a basic gradient.

More carving / modelling.

A test done on the south-west corner of the map, basically a pre-vis just to know roughly what direction I'm heading
