# Bryce Canyon (Incomplete)

This project was started to improve upon the mistakes made in the [Norwegain Landscape Map](/about/hobbies/games/minecraft/builds/norwegian-landscape/index.md) with further research and studying. This will help ensure the terrain can accurately represent the real-life version as much as possible.

The map will be 3000 x 3000 blocks in size and will be 1:1 scale.

The final result should be an extremely detailed map inspired by the geology of Bryce Canyon, not a replica.

## Assets

Unlike the [Norwegian Landscape Map](/about/hobbies/games/minecraft/builds/norwegian-landscape/), all assets will be made by me.

The foliage assets such as bushes and trees represent their real-life species.
