# Chain Tree

This build didn't have any reason to it, I just merged some concepts that I have seen but haven't used before.

Added a layer of texturing for the chains and terrain. Also added a beach and waterfalls.

A method I used to simulate rainfall, the colours represent how much rain there is coming from the tree.
