# Post Review

The main issue with this map is the lack of pre-planning. Luckily it turned out pretty good, but this meant some terrain may not be as realistic as I would like. This can be shown in the [Build Process](build-process.md) with how unplanned it felt.

If I were to do this agian I would try to simulate the erosion which carved the mountains and directed the rivers.

Those are the only mistakes I can think of which I could improve upon.
