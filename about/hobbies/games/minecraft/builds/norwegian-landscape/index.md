# Norwegian Landscape

Norwegian landscape is stunning and has always been a bucket list holiday for me. Taking inspiration from the sharp cliffs and the abundance of water, I put as much of Norway into one map!

The map is 2120x1591 and is 333 blocks from the lowest point to the highest.

It took just over 300 hours to complete this map and I put all of my efforts into making the perfect landscape by creating biomes and terrain shaped by tectonic movement while taking erosion into account. The purpose of this map is to provide a template for others to build structures without having to worry about making much terrain.

I have shared the zip file to my Patreon which includes multiple variants of the same map. 

- Base Terrain
  - Minimal texturing, only contains stone, moss and water.
- Snow
  - An exclusive version with a basic frozen texture.
- Textured
  - Fully textured terrain with different palettes per biome.
- Decorations
  - Includes trees, rocks and vegitation alongside full texturing
