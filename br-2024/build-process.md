# Build Process

Here are a collection of screenshots (some with descriptions) that show the build stages in order of old to most new.

A very basic test made before the comp, just something to work off in my head.

The first stages of the build, however I decided to work top to bottom. This ended up being a mistake later on.

Removed the top cabin and fixed some proportions. I also got the wood texture sorted out.

The second attempt, started over and made a slightly darker texture for the wood. Working bottom to top should have been more obvious.

More woodwork.

A method I used to generate grass. As shown with glass and wool, the grass length is determined by light, while the grass density is determined by moisture. I then coded a brush using Axiom's Script Brush feature to combine these factors into "real" grass.

Working on the [Frog Easter Egg](easter-eggs.md#frog-under-the-stairs).

Added slanted planks for the walls and added support for the roof.

Finished the roof, added railing added a pulley and added a chimney.

Started work on the interior and added windows.

Added a TV antenna.

Added further texturing to wooden surfaces using a custom script which detects edges and provides the appropriate stair direction and type.
![Image](/img/br-2024/build-process/27a.png)

Redid the windows as the scale was off.

Screenshot with the background added.

Added further texturing to the walls and added gas canisters.
![Image](/img/br-2024/build-process/30.png)

Redid the interior to match the correct scale.
![Image](/img/br-2024/build-process/31.png)

Moved the bed and added a stove connected to the gas canisters, draws and a wood burner.
