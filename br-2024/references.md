After figuring I might build a fire lookout tower, I watched a few videos on what it's like to live in a lookout tower. One of these videos was ["48 hours alone in an abandoned fire lookout"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRfMxfCJQeM) by Rosa, giving a great look into what it's like.

Another reference I used was an image of Spruce Mountain Lookout. I used this mainly for the structural parts of the build, but not making a full replica.
