# Inspiration

I used a lot of inspiration for this build, reading up on stories of lookout tower workers, and watching many videos on YouTube about life in a lookout tower.

## My love of lookout towers

Way back before this competition started, I saw a video on ["Life as the Last Fire Lookout"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtfEtIs_4DQ) by Aidin Robbins. The concept of living alone, out in the wilderness amazed me. So ever since watching that video, I've had a decent amount of interest in lookout towers.

Later on, I got my first playthrough of the Firewatch game and it's honestly one of my favorite games out there.
