# Editor

The editor is where replays can be played back and exported. To access the replay editor, navigate to the main menu and press the button with the flashback icon. In the 'Select Replay' menu, your previous [recordings](/flashback/docs/recording/index.md) will be listed in order of recently recorded.

Similar to the world selection screen, clicking play on a replay will load the replay editor.
