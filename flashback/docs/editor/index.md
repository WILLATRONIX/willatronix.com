# Editor

The editor is where replays can be played back and exported. To access the replay editor, navigate to the main menu and press the button with the flashback icon. In the 'Select Replay' menu, your previous [recordings](/flashback/docs/recording/index.md) will be listed in order of recently recorded.

Similar to the world selection screen, clicking play on a replay will load the replay editor. Using the buttons on the bottom of the screen, you can open, edit and delete the selected replay. Editing the replay is different to opening it, editing will allow you to modify the metadata attached to the replay such as [Keyframes](timeline/keyframes.md) and [Visuals](visuals.md).

You may also return to the main menu by pressing the 'Back' button. The 'Flashback Settings' button will open the [Configuration Menu](/flashback/docs/recording/config.md).

## Navigating the Replay

Once you've loaded your replay, you can move using the default movement keys. To look, use left-click while hovering over the game window. To increase your flight speed, hold left-click on the game window and scroll up or down.

## Windows

On the lower third of the screen, the [Timeline](timeline/index.md) will be displayed. On the right side of the screen, the [Visuals Window](visuals.md) will be shown. Both windows can be undocked and moved around by dragging the upper part of the window.

Located on the top of the game window will be the main menu bar. This includes the ability to [Export](exporting.md), hide the windows and show the Player List.

## Player List

The player list is useful for large servers like Hypixel where the player is always teleporting between worlds and locations. Next to each listed player, is the option to teleport to the player and hide that specific player.
