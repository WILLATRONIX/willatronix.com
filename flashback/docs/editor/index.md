# Editor

The editor is where replays can be played back and exported. To access the replay editor, navigate to the main menu and press the button with the flashback icon. In the 'Select Replay' menu, your previous [recordings](/flashback/docs/recording/index.md) will be listed in order of recently recorded.

Similar to the world selection screen, clicking play on a replay will load the replay editor. Using the buttons on the bottom of the screen, you can open, edit and delete the selected replay. Editing the replay is different to opening it, editing will allow you to modify the metadata attached to the replay such as [Keyframes](timeline/keyframes.md) and [Visuals](visuals.md).

## Navigating the Replay

Once you've loaded your replay, you can move using the default movement keys. To look, use left-click while hovering over the game window. To increase your flight speed, hold left-click on the game window and scroll up or down.

On the lower third of the screen, the [Timeline](timeline/index.md) will be displayed. On the right side of the screen, the [Visuals Window](visuals.md) will be shown.

Both windows can be undocked and moved around by dragging the upper part of the window. Pressing the F1 key will hide both windows.
